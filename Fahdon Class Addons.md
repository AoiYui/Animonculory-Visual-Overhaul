# Sorcerer
Besting the most well-equipped fighters, Sorcerers rely on the spells of the mystic arts. Unique to these mages is the bodily stamina to be armed with the thickest armor. Sorcerers also possess the unique ability to absorb magicka from spells targeted at them, serving in essence as magical "batteries," and possess more magicka than any other mage class.

Sorcerers are adept at the use of a wide variety of weapons and armor, but typically do not utilize shields, preferring to keep their hands free for defensive spellcasting instead, their specialty.

## **Abilities:**

**Spell Devourer** - Functioning as a magical "battery", you absorb magicka from spells which target you. *(Magicka Restored on spell hit == all your spell absorption effects' magnitudes * the calculated magicka cost of the spell / 100)*

**Arcane Knight** - You have mastered the art of manipulating magicka to enhance your physical abilities. You learn Heavy Armor skills 10% faster and additionally gain +50 to magicka. However, you suffer a loss of -25 to your health.

# Make AVO work with LOOT

## Preamble

While LOOT will not solve any conflicts for you and it is no substitude for proper patching, it allows easy sorting for anyone who just wants to add a few mods.
To get AVO to work with LOOT, there are a few steps required to ensure that LOOT won't mess up the custom load order.

## How to set it up

1) You need to open the mod named ``LOOT Copy to AppData`` in Explorer. Right click on the mod in MO2 to see this option
2) Open LOOT in the drop down Executables menu in MO2
3) Navigate to File at the top left and click on ``Open LOOT Data Folder``

4) Copy the games folder from the mod you opened before directly into the Data folder you opened with LOOT
5) Close LOOT and re-open it again
6) Now you can safely run LOOT as it will not mess with the custom load order anymore
